<strong>ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned from Building This Project<strong/>
<br/>
This was my first mini project â€” a Number Guessing Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though it's a small game, I learned a lot of valuable concepts while building it:<br/>

âœ… DOM Manipulation â€“ I learned how to dynamically update content, styles, and user interactions.<br/>

âœ… Functions â€“ I understood how to structure my code better using reusable functions.<br/>

âœ… Conditional Logic â€“ Practiced using if-else statements and also explored the ternary operator.<br/>

âœ… DRY Principle â€“ Learned the importance of Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself and how to write cleaner, reusable code.<br/>

âœ… CSS Class Pitfall â€“ Discovered that if a class has two words (like btn primary), it is treated as two separate classes. This concept initially confused me and caused a bug in my code, but now I understand how it works.<br/>

This project helped me build confidence in JavaScript and get comfortable with basic web development tools. I'm excited to keep improving!
